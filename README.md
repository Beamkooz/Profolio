# Profolio Data science and Data Analyst

## My Name is Nalin Amornratthamrong (Beam)

I am a fourth-year Chemical Engineering student from Faculty of Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering.

I became more interested in data and did a thesis related to Machine Learning,so I really liked this field and wanted to work in this field a lot.

My Skill and Project :
  **1. Python**
  - Churn Prediction (Telco_Dataset) 
    - Machine Learning model using KNN
    - Normalization data with StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
    - improve model with Cross Validation and GridSearch
  - Mini-Project_Analyrtic_Retail (Retail_Dataset)
    - Analysis with pandas, numpy
    - Create a dataframe of each category
    - Find the top 10 products
    - Basic Chart
  - Prediction_and_Genetic_Algorithm (Graduation Project)
    - Use python for creating machine learning model with algorithm such as Liner Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian Process for predict properties of chemical substances
    - Create a Genetic Algorithm to find substance that fit the specify properties.
  3. R
  4. SQL
  5. Excel and Google Sheet
  6. Power BI
